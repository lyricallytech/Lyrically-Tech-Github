I am a Salesforce system admin that is passionate about hip hop and building skills within tech to one day becoming a Salesforce Developer. _Lyrically Tech_ is a brand bridging my two interests to entertain and share knowledge about the power of Salesforce for entrepreneurs. Along with Salesforce I am a fan of technologies including: Python, Visual Studio Code, Integromat, and Squarespace. Helpful resources will be shared for all to enjoy but this page will especially be for the music lovers and tech professionals. Welcome and peace to you for visiting!
