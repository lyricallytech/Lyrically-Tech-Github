Lyrically Tech - Freestyle 001 Lyrics
Artist: 'Rïf
Inspired By: '93 'Til Infinity by Souls of Mischief

Without even trying, I'm shining
Steady dropping gems, I'm rare worth like a diamond
Stacking chips off tech and now even the rhymin' 
Grand entrance when I walk in price rising
Made it this far and I'm still in one piece 
Lived multiple lives and now there ain't one 'Rïf
Another decade soon about to turn a new leaf
And I'm only chasing green I'm avoiding all of beef
Now, vacation I'm mistaken for a star
And once upon a time man these dreams were dumb far
And seemed so outta reach, turns I was wrong
This was before I ever wrote my first song and 
Making dollars outta 15 cents every day 
I'm bout digits they 'bout pennies they do it the harder way 
In the city scene/seen more action than Michael Bay 
Story starts in Queens where I was a Kid n' Played and
I'm older but wiser still the same hunger
Pops said aim for the moon since was younger 
Out this world now I'm a star
Born in and as a winter but my vibes like the summer
And I came a long way, went from cold to hot 
Ain't have our own cribs, used to smoke on the block
Moms hate all the time how I stay high a lot 
But I handle all my business and the dough is what I got now
Anything’s possible now I do believe it
You got your health and your freedom then you can achieve it 
'Cause you gotta think smart work smart not harder
America’s a cold bitch and I been got her and
I'm gettin my slice of the pie with no pain
All I ever wanted was cheese so I kept it plain 
'Til infinity I play it smart never foolish 
Women come to the crib then turn into a nudist
I’m a king I’m a legend butchu already knew this
I’m at peace always calm I be chillin' like a Buddhist
Tryna stay alive and avoiding any Judas 
Writing code in 'em computers
I'm the opposite of losers *expletive* 
Educated hometown Ms. Lauryn
Score, I’m number 1 like the month I was born in 
Flow hot scorching I'm 'bout to make a fortune 
Shout out to my real ones showing love endorsing 
You ain’t gotta like it butchu gon respect it
Since young, all I heard was “Yo you gon' be next kid” 
Capricorn like Bezos the moons where I’m headed
Married to success on my birthdate we wedded 
Wise men told me stay true life gonna test ya
Ask my teachers though yo I never missed a lecture
Treated classrooms like mental adventures
The near death experiences let me know I might make it under pressure 
This my life
This my life
This is how I feel
This my life
This my life
This is how I feel
Peace and long life everybody that's from Shadyville
From Queens Village all the way down to Rosedale
